Problems running this demo with Google Chrome & Edge on a local disk.
======================================================================

Please note. This principal demo, accessed by index.html, will not run correctly on a local disk in Google Chrome 
or Microsoft Edge. The issue is related to the use of the top frame in the navigation script of the demo, an issue 
alien to TeeChart itself. We will correct the problem for the next release.

In the meantime for local use only with Chrome & Edge, please access the demos via the indexLocal.html page. The
demo loads correctly from disk under Firefox.

The principal index.html demo runs fine under Chrome & Edge when loaded onto/run-from a web server.
